                            New Experience</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">It is an experience for brothers and sisters who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior and wish to fulfill His commandment "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations”
<br>It will be a personal experience with believing brothers of churches in Honduras united to reach those that are going through difficulties and have not received the gospel in their hearts and make them their disciples in the power of God. Going two at a time, would sometimes be with a child interpreter, a teacher, a pastor or a brother who will only have the love of God and salvation in Christ in common.&nbsp;<br><br>We want to emphasize personal devotion and an intimate encounter with a new presence and manifestation of God, where you will have tasks and visits together with a personal time to reflect on the transcendent moments of life, visiting Copan Ruins, coffee farms cutting and processing, or going into the calm waters of the Chiquila River with basin in search of a gold nugget. While meditating you will discover the newness of God.
<br>You will have the experience of traveling from the USA with a group of brothers who come with a very similar goal and dream but with the same commandment, willing to try and develop their faith in the unforeseen events that a trip like this can give us.
<br>Being Honduras a poor country where needs are many, it’s good not only to share hugs, the Word and prayer, but also to bring food, food and medicine to share with those that are abandoned in the loneliness of the countryside and the jungle, or crammed into the misery and barbarism of a marginal neighborhood, or an old musical instrument with the children of schools where we have classical music and orchestra programs and English as a Second Language, bringing in your hands and ours, hope to all these groups, hope for a new Life in Abundance.&nbsp;<br></p>
